<h3>Neighborhood Map</h3>

This is an application that shows some of the places I go to walk the dog.
<br>
There is a button on the top left that toggles the visibilty of 
the list items so that it gets out of the way of the map view.
I made all clickable text flash to indicate activation, and list items dissappear automatically when clicked.
<br>
Input text filters markers and list items.
Info windows contain data from Foursquare.

Thanks for Reviewing
