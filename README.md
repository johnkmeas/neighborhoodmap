# Neightborhood Map

This is the my first application. It displays my top 5 places to walk the dog.

## KnockoutJs

This is a good intro to data-binding and was fun to learn and apply MVC architecture.

## Foursquare Api

I looped through locations and request data from Foursquare. The infowindows are populated with the data recieved for each location.

### Things to do later

- Display images from Foursquare venue photos.
